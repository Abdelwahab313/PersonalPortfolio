# CONTENT

Single source for what the site says and how it says it. The CV is the source of truth for
facts; this file is the source of truth for site wording. When the two disagree, fix the CV
first, then this file, then `src/data/portfolio.ts` and the page meta in the Astro layout
(`src/layouts/Base.astro`).

CV source: `~/projects/playground/Awesome-CV`, branch `cv/automattic-experienced-swe`, files under

### Employment

| Company | Location | Title | Dates |
|---|---|---|---|
| OnTheGoSystems (WPML — WordPress plugins) | Remote (Hong Kong) | Senior Software Engineer | Dec 2024 – Present |
| Dailymealz | Riyadh, Saudi Arabia | Senior Software Engineer | Dec 2021 – Dec 2024 |
| Nformacy | Cairo, Egypt | Full-Stack Developer | Oct 2020 – Dec 2021 |
| DevSquads (formerly Fikr Labs) | Cairo, Egypt | Software Engineer | Jan 2018 – Oct 2020 |

Four entries, not five. OnTheGoSystems is current; every earlier entry is past tense.

### Skills (same rows as the CV)

| Row | Skills |
|---|---|
| Languages | PHP, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java (Spring), Python, SQL |
| Backend | Ruby on Rails, Node.js, REST API design, service-oriented architecture, SQS, Kafka |
| Frontend | Next.js, React, Redux, Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus), React Native, Tailwind CSS |
| AI & LLM | AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, Gemini, agentic workflows, Claude Agent SDK, MCP, Langfuse, evals |
| Cloud & Infrastructure | AWS (ECS Fargate, Lambda, SQS, Step Functions, CloudWatch, S3, IAM), Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI |
| Observability | Datadog, OpenTelemetry, AWS CloudWatch, Langfuse tracing |
| Databases | PostgreSQL, MySQL, Aurora, Redis, DynamoDB, ClickHouse |
| Testing | TDD, Spec-driven development, RSpec, Capybara, Playwright, Cypress, Jest, VCR |
| WordPress & Compatibility | WPML ecosystem, plugin update safety, backwards compatibility, i18n |
| Spoken Languages | English, Arabic (native) |

Site skill icons are a subset of this table, in this order: Ruby on Rails, AWS, Terraform,
Docker, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Python, React, JavaScript, React Native, Node.js. Anything
not in the table above does not get an icon (drops Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, ClickHouse,
Laravel, Firebase, html-5, css3, sass).

## 2. Tone

The CV is terse and third person. The site is first person and a little warmer. Same facts,
same numbers, same order of emphasis: platform and backend first, LLM systems second,
frontend last.

Rules, in priority order:

1. **Past tense for every job.** OnTheGoSystems is current, so its present-tense bullets stay
   present. Every earlier entry is past tense.
2. **Concrete over abstract.** A bullet names a system, a change, and why. "Built full-stack
   features across the translation pipeline" says nothing. "Moved the product off a single EC2
   host onto ECS Fargate" says something.
3. **Every number comes from the CV.** The CV is the defensible set. Do not add a number it does
   not carry, and do not restate a CV number at a different precision.
4. **No template voice.** Banned: "cool stuff", "like a pro", "whipping up", "slick",
   "silky-smooth", "crush goals", "all the things", "leveling up", "tech tricks", "love affair",
   "I'm that guy". No exclamation marks.
5. **No emoji in prose.** Emoji may remain only where the template uses them as icons
   (section headings), not inside sentences.
6. **No em dashes in site prose.** Use a full stop or a comma. Company and product names taken
   verbatim from the CV are exempt (for example `OnTheGoSystems (WPML — WordPress plugins)`).
7. **No self-assessment numbers.** Proficiency bars off (`viewSkillBars: false`).
8. **One sentence on availability**, in the hero. Location, timezone, what roles.
9. **No filler lines.** The Geophysics "leveraged strong analytical skills" sentence goes.
10. **Company and product names exactly as in section 1.** Not "DailyMealz", "nformacy",
    "Devsquads", "Fikrlabs".
11. **CV stays canonical until told otherwise.** Never "fix" the site by inventing a fact the
    CV lacks (Shell scripting is the standing example: real, but not on the CV, so not on the
    site). The only way to add such a fact is to update the CV first.

## 3. Site copy

Paste-ready. Keys refer to `src/portfolio.js` unless noted.

### Hero (`greeting.title`, `greeting.subTitle`)

Title: `Hi, I'm Abdelwahab`

Subtitle:

> Senior software engineer, eight years in. I build production AWS systems and own them from
> architecture through deployment to reliability: Node.js and TypeScript services, a delivery
> platform serving 100K daily users, and WPML's LLM translation and agent platform on 1.5M+
> WordPress sites. I am usually the one who finds out why production broke. Cairo, UTC+3. Open
> to remote senior backend, platform and AI-platform roles.

### Meta (`public/index.html` title, description, og, twitter)

Title: `Abdelwahab Mahmoud | Senior Software Engineer, Full-stack & Platform`

Description:

> Abdelwahab Mahmoud, senior software engineer in Cairo. Ruby on Rails, AWS (ECS Fargate,
> Lambda, Terraform) and LLM platforms over Bedrock, OpenAI and Gemini. Eight years building
> and operating production systems.

### Skills section (`skillsSection.title`, `skillsSection.subTitle`, `skillsSection.skills`)

Title: `What I do`

Subtitle:

> Backend and platform first: Ruby on Rails, AWS and the database under it. LLM systems over
> Bedrock, OpenAI and Gemini, with the reliability work that makes them boring. React and
> Hotwire when the feature needs a front end.

Bullets (replace all six):

- Backend systems in Ruby on Rails, from background job internals to metered billing.
- AWS platform work: ECS Fargate, Lambda, Terraform and CloudWatch, from capacity study to deploy pipeline.
- LLM integration: a provider-agnostic engine over Bedrock, OpenAI and Gemini, with fallback chains, evaluation harnesses and MCP.
- Root-cause investigation on production incidents, separating what is verified from what is inferred.
- Frontend when it is needed: React, Hotwire, React Native.

### Work experience (`workExperiences.experience`)

**OnTheGoSystems (WPML — WordPress plugins)**, Senior Software Engineer, December 2024 – Present

> I worked on Private Translation Cloud (PTC), an AI translation platform from the team behind
> WPML, the multilingual plugin that powers over a million WordPress sites. Product work in
> Rails and React, and the AWS platform underneath it.

- Built the multi-provider translation LLM engine behind WPML (Bedrock, OpenAI, Gemini): fallback chains, JSON repair and rate-limit retries keep translations flowing when a provider degrades.
- Built the guardrails agents run behind: an MCP server exposing live databases, logs and selected APIs through authenticated, monitored access, adopted as the team's standard agent integration path.
- Owned credits and billing correctness for a metered LLM product; one authorization architecture to replace scattered permission checks.
- Own an agentic triage platform that handles first-line incident and support inquiries, cutting Mean Time To Resolve.
- Cleared Aurora MySQL's worst-query backlog query by query: rewritten plans, covering indexes and restructured hot reads, until CPU pressure stopped turning into incidents.
- Replaced ECS autoscaling with a queue-depth Lambda autoscaler that drains long-running jobs instead of killing them.
- Owned the GitLab CI/CD pipelines: build, e2e test, SAST and deploy gates for every service in the product.
- Kept plugin APIs backwards compatible across releases with deprecation paths and contract tests.
- Migrated the product onto AWS ECS Fargate running Docker containers, and own the platform and its Terraform.

Source: all nine bullets follow `examples/resume/experience.tex` on
`cv/automattic-experienced-swe` (aligned 2026-10-08). Bullets 4 and 9 stay present tense
because the job is current.

**Dailymealz**, Senior Software Engineer, December 2021 – December 2024

> Built and scaled a meal subscription platform serving customers across Saudi Arabia, with a
> React Native driver app and the Node.js services behind it.

- Built the real-time order service behind a 100,000 daily-user delivery product: kitchen, driver and delivery status pushed to mobile and web clients over Node.js and Socket.IO.
- Cut Mean Time To Resolve by 30% by instrumenting order, driver and kitchen flows with Datadog and OpenTelemetry.
- Decomposed the fulfillment component out of the PHP/Laravel monolith into a standalone service in a distributed event-driven architecture, passing state changes over AWS SQS behind a REST API contract.
- Chose incremental extraction over a full event-driven rewrite, because a team of six could not freeze features for months to run two partially consistent systems.
- Served hot order state from Redis in a write-behind cache pattern with MySQL behind it, keeping status fan-out off the transactional path.
- Migrated the real-time order service from JavaScript to TypeScript so event and message payload mismatches fail at compile time, not at runtime in front of customers.
- Led a team of five building a driver location check-in system: planning, reviews and pairing across the driver app.

**Nformacy**, Full-Stack Developer, October 2020 – December 2021

> Built Nformacy, a knowledge marketplace that connects business advisors with companies that
> need their expertise. Full-stack work in React and Ruby on Rails, from the first MVP to the
> beta launch, plus the cloud infrastructure and deploy pipelines.

- Led full-stack features from requirements to deployment, and moved the web apps to a SaaS model.
- Built mentor calendar booking with Zoom, ClickUp and calendar integrations.
- Wrote BDD tests and managed CI/CD pipelines.

**DevSquads (formerly Fikr Labs)**, Software Engineer, January 2018 – October 2020

> My first job in tech, at a Cairo venture studio that became DevSquads, an agile consultancy
> that takes XP seriously: TDD, pair programming and continuous delivery. Delivered products for
> international clients, including Shapa, a US health tech platform (React, React Native, Node.js,
> Java Spring).

- Built software in self-organizing Extreme Programming teams with TDD, thin vertical slices and test-covered refactoring of legacy code, across React Native, Ruby on Rails, Java Spring and React.
- Mentored teams adopting XP and Agile practices: pairing, code review discipline and iterative planning.

Four entries. The old separate Fikr Labs entry is gone: Fikr Labs is the earlier name inside
the DevSquads entry, exactly as the CV states it.

#### Timeline metadata (`duration`, `location`, `tags` on each entry)

The experience section renders as a vertical timeline. Each entry carries a duration and a
short location next to the date, and a row of tech chips under the text. Duration is the
month difference between the two dates. Tags may only name tech that already appears in that
entry's own description or bullets.

| Company | duration | location | tags |
|---|---|---|---|
| OnTheGoSystems (WPML — WordPress plugins) | 1 yr 10 mo | Remote (Hong Kong) | Ruby on Rails, React, ECS Fargate, Lambda, Terraform, Aurora, Bedrock |
| Dailymealz | 3 yrs | Riyadh | React Native, Node.js, AWS, Datadog, Redis |
| Nformacy | 1 yr 2 mo | Cairo | React, Ruby on Rails |
| DevSquads (formerly Fikr Labs) | 2 yrs 9 mo | Cairo | React, React Native, Node.js, Java Spring, TDD |

`duration` for OnTheGoSystems counts from December 2024 to the current month, so recompute it
whenever this file is updated. Entries with more than three bullets show three and a
"Show N more" toggle.

### Blog posts (`src/content/blog/`, replaces the old `caseStudies` section)

Case-study copy no longer lives in the data module or in this file. Each post is exactly one
file in `src/content/blog/{slug}.md`, discovered automatically by Astro content collections
and validated against the Zod schema in `src/content.config.ts`. Never edit a registry.

Authoring contract, field table and copy-paste template: `docs/BLOG.md`. Tone rules still
come from section 2 above.

Index page (`/blog`) chrome, owned by `src/pages/blog/index.astro`:

Title: `Blog`

Subtitle:

> Four systems from the last two years, plus whatever comes next. What was there, what
> I decided, what it cost, and what changed.

The four migrated case studies keep their copy verbatim from the 2026-10-05 refresh:
`fargate` (Draining, not stopping), `engine` (One engine, three providers), `aurora`
(7.33M rows per call), `triage` (The verdict lives in code, not the prompt).

Anonymized 2026-10-08: no product, company, or `*.wpml.org` link in any post.
Bodies and diagrams keep only the names of public tooling (AWS services, OpenAI,
Bedrock, Gemini, Langfuse). Rule of posting: docs/BLOG.md rule 3.

Numbers in those four trace to pre-2026-10-08 CV history; see SPEC.md section 8.

### Big projects (`bigProjects.title`, `bigProjects.subtitle`, `bigProjects.projects`)

Title: `Products`

Subtitle: `Products I helped build`

**Private Translation Cloud**

> AI translation service from the team behind WPML. I worked on the platform that translates
> websites automatically, and on the AWS infrastructure and LLM engine layer underneath it.

Other three cards unchanged except names per section 1.

### Code card (hero, `src/data/portfolio.ts` `codeSnippets`)

One profile, translated into four CV-listed languages. Rendered once at build time by
Shiki, switched by Language tabs in the hero. The code must state no fact the CV does not
carry (added 2026-10-08: TypeScript, Ruby, Go, SQL). Languages come from the CV languages
row only. Filenames: `engineer.ts`, `engineer.rb`, `engineer.go`, `query.sql`.

### Education (`educationInfo.schools[0]`)

subHeader: `BSc in Geophysics`. duration: `Sep 2012 – Jun 2016`. desc: empty.

### Contact (`contactInfo.title`, `contactInfo.subtitle`, `contactInfo.email_address`)

Title: `Contact me` (plain text, no emoji)

Subtitle:

> Hiring for a senior backend or platform role, or stuck on a production problem? Email me.

Email per section 1.

### Footer

Footer line, mono, small: `© 2026 Abdelwahab Mahmoud · built with astro · hosted on github pages`.
No developerFolio credit remains.

## 4. Field map

Where each fact lives, so an edit in one place is mirrored in the others.

| Fact | CV (`examples/resume/`) | Site |
|---|---|---|
| Title line | `../resume.tex` position field | `greeting.subTitle`, meta description, `CONTEXT.md` Positioning |
| Summary | `summary.tex` | `greeting.subTitle` |
| Jobs, titles, dates | `experience.tex` | `workExperiences.experience[]` |
| OTGS bullets | `experience.tex` first `cventry` | `workExperiences.experience[0].descBullets` |
| Skills | `skills.tex` | `skillsSection.skills`, `cvStack` (the `stack.json` card) |
| Email, phone | `../resume.tex` header | `socialMediaLinks.gmail`, `contactInfo` |
| Education | `education.tex` | `educationInfo` |
| Years figure | `summary.tex` | `greeting.subTitle`, `CONTEXT.md` Positioning |
| Code card | languages row of `skills.tex` | `codeSnippets` (four translations, no new facts) |
| Case-study and note copy | pre-2026-10-08 CV branches (SPEC.md section 8) | `src/content/blog/{slug}.md` |

Resume button (`greeting.resumeLink`) points at `/resume.pdf`, which is `public/resume.pdf`
in this repo and ships with every build as `https://abdelwahab.dev/resume.pdf`. On every CV
build, copy `examples/resume.pdf` from the CV repo over `public/resume.pdf` and redeploy.
Build the CV with `make resume.pdf` (LuaLaTeX), then re-run the extraction assertions in
SPEC.md section 7 before shipping.

## 5. Open items against the live site (2026-10-08)

- 2026-10-08 alignment: CV branch `cv/automattic-experienced-swe` @ `a0103b9` is the source
  of truth. Positioning is now `Full-stack & Platform`; OTGS is current (`Dec 2024 – Present`);
  there are four entries, not five; skills are ten rows; the summary leads with AWS production
  systems and scale. Everything above mirrors it.
- 2026-10-08 Astro rebuild (branch `astro-rebrand`, ADR 0001): the site moved from the CRA
  fork to Astro. The hero gained the Code card in four CV-listed languages (TS, Ruby, Go,
  SQL); skill icons were replaced by the `stack.json` card in `src/data/portfolio.ts`.
  Blog posts are `.md` files in a content collection. URLs (`/`, `/blog`, `/blog/{slug}`),
  the domain and `/resume.pdf` are unchanged. Deploy is `FOLDER: dist` on the `gh-pages`
  branch, triggered from `main`.
- The 2026-10-05 case-study numbers (65%, 16 months, 90% Spot, 7.33M, 1,013, 7 ms, four ADRs,
  ISO 27001) were retired from the CV on 2026-10-06. The four case studies keep them by
  decision; see SPEC.md section 6 and section 8.
- Case studies moved off the homepage into `/blog` on 2026-10-08, alongside future articles.
  Authoring contract: `docs/BLOG.md`.
- `public/resume.pdf` resynced 2026-10-08 (`d875cdf9`, CV `a0103b9`).
- Nformacy product link is `https://nformacy.com/` (the old
  `https://beta.nformacy.com/` origin is down, returns 522).
- The 2026-10-05 refresh added the visual identity rework (ink on paper, one accent, system
  diagrams). SPEC.md records those decisions.
